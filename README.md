# OpenthreadDotNet
.Net Core library is designed to work with the Thread network. To develop 6LoWPAN applications, you will need a radio module running as an OpenThread Network Co-Processor (NCP).
As end device can be used any module from supported platforms https://openthread.io/platforms with NCP firmware.
